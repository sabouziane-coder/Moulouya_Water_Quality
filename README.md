# Moulouya River Water Quality — PI prediction (Ensemble models)

This repository contains data and scripts for "AI-Driven Real-Time Prediction and Monitoring of Water Quality in the Moulouya River Basin, Morocco" (Y. [Your Name], et al.). It includes preprocessing code, Pollution Index (PI) calculation, ensemble model training (RF, GB, XGBoost), evaluation scripts, and the figures used in the manuscript.

## Repository structure

- `data/processed/` — processed CSV dataset (normalized)
- `src/` — preprocessing, PI calculation, training and plotting scripts
- `notebooks/` — exploratory analysis and modeling notebook
- `results/` — figures and saved models
- `docs/` — additional methodology details

## Reproducibility
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Create virtual environment (Python 3.11 recommended)
2. Install dependencies:
